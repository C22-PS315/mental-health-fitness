# Menfit: Mental Health Fitness

## Overview
Menfit is a service that allows users to identify whether they are affected with mental illness. This app identifies what kind of mental illness he/she faced based on questions answered by the users. Many people still experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights because of their mental conditions are known. This can cause many people to avoid consulting psychiatrists about their problem. Because people tend not to share their mind problem or mental illness experience towards other people, this app can predict and give recommendations to the users based on the questions that users answered. We leverage Android Studio with Kotlin for the Android application, Firebase to build the backend, and TensorFlow to build a model and training dataset. We built this product to help other people that have no courage to share their experiences coping with mental illness, so that they can identify sooner and get precise treatment.
